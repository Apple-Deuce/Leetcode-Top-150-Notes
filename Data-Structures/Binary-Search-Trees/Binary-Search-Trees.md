# Binary Search Trees

## Explanation

- Data Structure, that when visualized, looks like a tree
- Data points in a tree are called nodes
- Base of the tree is called the "root node"
- Each subsequent node can have child nodes
- Node previous to the focused node is called a "parent node"
- "Leaf nodes" are nodes at the end of a branch that have no children.
- In **Binary Search Trees**, each node can have only two branches.
- Binary Search Trees are ordered. Each left subtree is <= the parent node and all nodes in the right subtree are > the parent node.
- Since these trees use binary search, on average, half of the values can be skipped when operating. Timing of lookups, insertions and deletions are proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.
- Faster than linear time needed for finding items by key in an unsorted array, but slower than the corresponding actions on a hash table.
